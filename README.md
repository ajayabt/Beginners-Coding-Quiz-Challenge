# Beginners-Coding-Quiz-Challenge


## Description

This is a short multiple choice quiz developed for my bootcamp challenge. The timer is set to 100 and will reduce by 10s for each incorrect answer. The score given is the total time remaining. This can then be stored alongside initials as a high score. Scores can be viewed on the highscore page and cleared by using the button. The starter code included the full HTML and CSS files as well as the sound effect files.
